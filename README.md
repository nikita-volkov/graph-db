# GraphDB. A native graph database for Haskell

This library provides a mutable in-memory graph datastructure with complete ACID guarantees, a persistence layer, a server and a client.

## Project Status

Unreleased and currently on hold.

The project is compilable and the demos and tests execute fine, so you can get a feeling of what it's about.
